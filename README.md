## A project written in 2017

It is a question-answering system for the field of vehicle maintenance, using Spring-SpringMVC-Mybatis back-end framework, Bootstrap front-end framework and Mysql structured database.

### The core business of the system:

1. A user inputs a question about vehicle maintenance in natural language;
2. The system reprocesses the question and segments it into several words;
3. The similarity is calculated between these words and the phrases in the database;
4. The system returns the three answers with the highest similarity value to the user.

### The processing of the knowledge database:

1. search domain knowledge on websites;
2. collect and save url,title,content into database;
3. segment each content into phrases;
4. extract 5 phrases as keywords from each content and save them as an attribute value;
5. attributes in the database: id,url,title,keywords,content.

### Models and tools used:
1. segmentation--CRF; tool--ansj
2. knowledge aquisition from websites--WebCollectCrawler; tool--WebCollectCrawler
3. keyword extraction--TFIDF; tool--ansj
4. similarity calculation--word2vec; tool--word2vec
